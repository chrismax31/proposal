# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Stock Financial Analysis Tool

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that lets you enter a stock ticker and then gives you a multitude of financial information that helps one meake smarter investment decisions

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My program will prompt the user to enter a stock ticker, (Apple inc = aapl). Then the program will search Yahoo finance and retreive the necassary information from the website. This will be done by importing a few functions. The fuctions that will be imported will include but are not limited to, pandas, pandas_datareader, getpass,
matplotlib, datetime, tkinter. Once the data is imported it will generate useful charts like the sma10 v sma50 (simple moving average). The porgram will also provide vital financial information like EPS, P/E and other company health indicators. This will allow for one to make smarter investment decisions. If I have extra time I will add onto the program, prompting the user one's current portfolio amount and then the stocks one wants to get, and optimize one's portfolio.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

This will help me with my protfolio diversification analysis for my economics, finance and accounting classes. 

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A program that promtps the user for a stock ticker and then provides financial information in return.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to accomplish the portfolio optimization part of my project

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

If I have time I want to import my code to a website format

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to learn the micro details of certain functions like matplotlib in order to complete my project. Luckly I have been researching financial funcitons built into python since July, however there is always more to research. My partner and I will work together on almost every part of the project, this will ensure both of us are satisifed with the final product. Splitting a project up in my opinion is not working together. Parts of the project will be coded alone, however we will always check in with one another and give feedback.
